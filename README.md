## üéØ Project Overview

VBT prioritizes movement speed over traditional load-based approaches. The proposed device helps optimize training by:

- Measuring **movement velocity**, **power output**, and **symmetry**
- Counting reps and tracking the **bar path**
- Providing **real-time feedback** via dashboards and mobile interfaces

</p>


1. **Data Acquisition**  
   ESP32 collects IMU data and processes it locally.

2. **Data Transmission**  
   Data is sent to AWS IoT Core via MQTT with secure TLS.

3. **Cloud Processing**  
   - **AWS Lambda** processes messages
   - Metrics are calculated (velocity, power, reps)

4. **Data Storage**  
   - **AWS Timestream** stores time-series exercise data

5. **Visualization**  
   - **Grafana** dashboards provide interactive performance tracking.

## üì± Mobile App & Interface

- Initially planned via **AWS Amplify**, but replaced by **Grafana dashboards**
- Includes:
  - Real-time velocity monitoring
  - Historical performance tracking
  - Custom insights and training suggestions

## üß™ Implementation Notes

- Shift from Zolertia to ESP32 due to library compatibility
- Use of MQTT with TLS and IAM policies
- Cloud pipeline working end-to-end with Lambda and Grafana
- Future improvement: Optimize Lambda processing logic

---

## üîê Security Notes

- Uses TLS encryption for MQTT communication
- AWS Cognito for user authentication
- IAM policies to secure device and data access
